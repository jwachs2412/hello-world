# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.

Hi, my name is Josh Wachsman. I've been a Web Developer since 2012, focusing on the front-end for most of my experience.  I am looking to try my hands at Python and Data Analytics, while also learning React.js.

My wife and I have been married for 11 years and have 3 cats.
